// instruction-budget.test.mjs — a ratchet on the pack's standing instructions.
//
// The role prompts are the most expensive text this pack ships. On pi the whole
// role prompt is appended to the SYSTEM prompt on every `before_agent_start`
// (extensions/paseo-team-policy.ts), so its size is a per-turn tax for the life
// of the session; on Claude it goes in once as turn context, which is cheaper
// but also means the far end of a long contract is the part a model has drifted
// furthest from by turn fifty.
//
// Left alone, that text only grows. Every incident adds a paragraph and none of
// them removes one, because appending is always the smaller edit. The budgets
// below are NOT a runtime cap — no runtime this pack targets documents one for
// an appended system prompt, and inventing a number and calling it a cap would
// be worse than having none. They are set a little above today's largest file,
// so growth stops being free: crossing one is a decision somebody makes on
// purpose, by raising the number in the same commit and saying why, rather than
// something that happens over six months of reasonable-looking diffs.
//
// The remedy when a budget trips is almost never "raise the budget". It is the
// one upstream Paseo's own docs rules name: integrate, don't append — and state
// a fact once, with every other mention a link.
