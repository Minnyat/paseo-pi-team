/**
 * policy-core.ts — runtime-neutral role policy for the Paseo team pack.
 *
 * This module holds every rule that is TRUE REGARDLESS of which coding agent
 * executes the turn: task-brief parsing, peer authority derivation, the Paseo
 * MCP allowlists, the bash guards, and the git authority guard.
 *
 * It imports nothing from any agent runtime. Two thin adapters bind it to a
 * runtime and both MUST route every decision through here — a rule that lives
 * in only one adapter is a rule the other runtime silently lacks:
 *   - extensions/paseo-team-policy.ts              → Pi (extension API)
 *   - extensions/paseo-team-core/claude-policy.ts  → Claude Code (settings hooks)
 *
 * This module lives in a SUBDIRECTORY on purpose. Pi discovers
 * `~/.pi/agent/extensions/*.ts` as extensions, and a subdirectory is only
 * entered when it carries an index.ts/index.js or a package.json with a `pi`
 * field (loader.js resolveExtensionEntries) — neither exists here, so the core
 * is invisible to that scan while staying a plain `.ts` file that the repo's
 * review harness — and every tool that globs TypeScript sources — can see.

// does this seat live", and every governance read in this file is host-global:
// `buildStateIndex` walks EVERY cwd-slug under `$PASEO_HOME/agents`, and
// a domain fan-out runs `paseo ls -g`, the flag whose whole purpose
// is to escape cwd scoping. With one project on a host that difference never
// showed. With two it does, and in three separate ways:
//
//   - two unrelated projects that both label a seat `backend` make each other's
//     Supervisors contenders, so JURISDICTION_OVERLAP fires on a cluster that
//     has exactly one Supervisor;
//   - a Lead could `send_agent_prompt` another project's Lead, because the
//     ownership guard asks only "is the target a coordinator";
//   - `src/index.ts` is a lease scope in every repo on the machine, all filed
//     in one global ledger room.
//
// Derivation order is explicit-first, and every step is something Paseo already
// records, so an existing deployment gets scoping without relabelling anything:
//
//   1. labels["team.cluster"]  — the operator's own grouping. Needed because a
//      seat can still sit in a different workspaceId or cwd from its Lead (one a
//      Human created by hand, or an agent from before one-workspace-per-job):
//      only a declared label can keep it in its Lead's cluster.
//   2. workspaceId             — Paseo's own boundary when there is one.
//   3. cwd                     — what a plain `paseo run` has instead.
//   4. null                    — unknown.
//
// The `null` case is why `clustersSeparate` exists rather than a plain `!==`.
// This file's own precedent (teamTopology) is that a misread must cost a
// blocked call with a reason, never governance that silently turned itself off.
// Narrowing on a GUESS would do the second thing: it would drop a genuinely
// contending Supervisor out of the overlap set and hide a real conflict. So
// separation must be PROVEN — unknown on either side means "not separate", the
// refusal stands, and the operator sees the same behaviour as today.

// Everything above this line is Supervisor-INITIATED: the Supervisor observes
// on a heartbeat, forms a verdict, and sends it. That left the Lead with
// exactly one addressable party for a question of its own — the Human. So the
// measured behaviour was a Lead that asked the Human about matters its own
// contract had already delegated, which is the failure mode `lead.md`
// invariant 6b exists to prevent, arriving through the one door 6b does not
// cover: the Lead speaking first.
//
// The channel is `lead_ask_supervisor`, deliberately shaped like the block it
// wants back rather than like a bare message:
//
//   - it carries OPTIONS, EVIDENCE and REVERSIBILITY, which are three of the
//     four Delegated-decision criteria in `supervisor.md`. A consult that
//     cannot fill them is one the Supervisor would have bounced anyway, so the
//     schema refuses it at the sender rather than after a round trip;
//   - it is delivered as a PROMPT (`paseo send`) because
//     a prompt wakes an idle Supervisor AND opens a turn — which is what makes
//     the notice below fire;
//   - a cluster with no Supervisor seat is a NAMED answer
//     (`NO_SUPERVISOR_SEAT`), not a silent fallback to the Human. That is the
//     whole point: the Human is reached because nobody else could be, and the
//     Lead can say so.
//
// The Supervisor side is the mirror of `supervisorTurnNotice`. A Lead that
// receives a decision is told to act on it; a Supervisor that receives a
// consult is told that answering is not optional and that the answer has
// exactly two shapes — decide, or escalate naming which criterion failed.

 * Measured 2026-09-07 against the running daemon (`@getpaseo/server` 0.7.2,

 *
 *   this.currentMode = isPermissionMode(config.modeId) ? config.modeId : "default";
 *
 * A Claude seat created WITHOUT an explicit mode comes up on `default`
 * ("Always Ask") — never on `auto`. `paseo provider ls` reports
 * `defaultMode=auto` for every `claude-*` role provider, and that value is
 * catalog metadata only: the daemon uses it to PRESELECT a mode in its own
 * pickers (`hub/starter-agent-runtime.js` marks it `suggested`) and applies it
 * nowhere at create time. `resolveAndValidateCreateAgentMode` returns
 * `undefined` for a parentless create with no requested mode, and `undefined`
 * is exactly what the line above turns into `"default"`.
 *
 * Reproduced end to end the same day, on a real daemon:
 *
 *   paseo run --provider claude-peer/claude-haiku-4-5 ...   (no --mode)
 *     -> paseo agent inspect  =>  Mode: default
 *   paseo run --provider claude-peer/claude-haiku-4-5 ... --mode auto
 *     -> paseo agent inspect  =>  Mode: auto
 *
 * So "auto is the default" is only true of the paths that SAY auto. Every path
 * that stays quiet hands back a seat whose every tool call parks in the
 * pending-permission queue — the seat looks hung from the outside while its
 * creator spends turns on `list_pending_permissions`. That is not a narrowing
 * anybody chose; it is a default nobody typed.
 *
 * pi is exempt because it declares no modes at all (`AvailableModes: []`,
 * `DynamicModes: false`; `paseo agent mode <pi-agent> --list` answers `[]`),
 * which is why every pi seat reads `Mode: default` while waiting for nobody.
